        <p>Hi, my love! It's Kimkim's day today hehe. I am so glad to be able to celebrate your birthday with you.
            Look how amazing it is, babe—we started celebrating as housemates/friends, then as besties, now as lovers, 
            and soon hopefully as wives. I am so proud of you, babe.</p>
